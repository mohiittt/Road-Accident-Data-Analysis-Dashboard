## Project Overview
This Excel dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of road accident data, focusing on key factors such as road types, surface conditions, and monthly trends. Designed to help users understand accident patterns, this tool enables stakeholders to identify contributing factors to road accidents and assess trends over time.

## Features
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visual summary of accident data, providing quick insights at a glance.
- **Data Analysis**: Detailed breakdowns and calculations for deeper insights.
- **KPI Metrics**: Key performance indicators to assess accident frequency, severity, and other vital statistics.
- **Road Type & Surface Analysis**: Accident distribution based on road types and conditions.
- **Donut Charts**: Visual representation of data, categorizing accident attributes for easier interpretation.
- **Monthly Trend Analysis**: Seasonal breakdown to understand monthly accident patterns and peak times.

## Sheet Descriptions
1. **Dashboard**: The main interactive summary page, displaying key insights and metrics.
2. **Data Analysis**: A dedicated section for analysis, including calculations that feed into the visualizations.
3. **Data**: Raw data source sheet containing all road accident records.
4. **KPI**: Key metrics derived from the raw data, focusing on accident severity, frequency, and other performance indicators.
5. **Road Type**: Analysis and visualizations based on different types of roads where accidents occurred.
6. **Road Surface**: Insights on how various road surface conditions correlate with accident data.
7. **Donut Charts**: Specialized charts to represent categorized data such as accident causes or types.
8. **Monthly Trend**: Shows accident frequency trends by month, providing a temporal view of accident data.

## Requirements
- **Software**: Microsoft Excel (2016 or later recommended for optimal compatibility).
